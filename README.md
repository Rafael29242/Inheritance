# Inheritance

- Circle.cs, Rectangle.cs, Square.cs, Triangle.cs, AND Shape.cs. Shape.cs should have a Color Field and 2 Color Methods (GetColor() and SetColor()). The other 4 classes should Inherit from Shape. Because they Inherit from Shape, they will also have the Color Field and the 2 Color Methods. The initial 4 classes should NOT have their own Color Field and should NOT have implementations of the 2 Color Methods.
